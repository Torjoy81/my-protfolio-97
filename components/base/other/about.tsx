        I'm a dedicated front-end developer with an interest for designing user
        interfaces that are simple to understand and visually appealing. I have
        worked with both frontend and backend, including API management,
        authentication, and web sockets.
      </p>
      <p class={"text-justify mt-4 xs:px-8 font-poppins font-light"}>
        I have significant experience working with Vue.js, a popular JavaScript
        framework for building user interfaces. Through my projects, I have
        developed a strong understanding of Vue's core concepts and ecosystem,
        allowing me to make a interactive component to component and creating a
        responsive web applications.In addition, I have started an exploration
        into Angular, another powerful frontend framework. Even though I am only
        getting started with Angular, I have already learned a lot Because it
        has same concept alike vue or react.I am getting with Typescript Because
        recently I worked a couple of features of frontend like
        pagination,filter,form,Dialog, etc. Those experiences made me get along
        with Typescript
      </p>
      <p class={"text-justify mt-4 xs:px-8 font-poppins font-light"}>
        Finally I would like to say that I'm not a complete full stack
        developer.that's why I'm looking for an opportunity to be better for not
        only learn technical thing but also manners. I am quick and good
        learner. as example This Protfolio has been made by Fresh and deno.
